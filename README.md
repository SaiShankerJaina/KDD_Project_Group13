### Project Introduction:
The dataset we have chosen for our project is the Alzheimer's Disease dataset, sourced from Kaggle. This dataset was created by Rabie El Kharoua and includes various features related to Alzheimer's disease diagnosis, including demographic data, clinical data, and neuroimaging results. Our primary goal is to develop a predictive model to aid in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. This project will employ supervised learning techniques, specifically focusing on classification to distinguish between different stages of Alzheimer's disease.
Our project aims to be both descriptive and predictive. We will start with exploratory data analysis (EDA) to describe the data and understand the underlying patterns and relationships. Following this, we will build predictive models to classify the stage of Alzheimer's disease based on the given features.

### Research Question:
Can we accurately predict the stage of Alzheimer's disease using demographic, clinical, and neuroimaging data?
