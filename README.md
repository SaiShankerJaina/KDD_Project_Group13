### Project Introduction:
This project aims to analyze a dataset related to Alzheimer's disease, focusing on descriptive and diagnostic analytics to uncover patterns and insights within the data. The dataset, which includes information such as age, gender, BMI, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, MMSE scores, and diagnosis group, was sourced from a publicly available repository (link to be provided). The goal is to understand the relationships between these variables and identify any significant trends or correlations that may aid in further research or clinical practice.

Given the nature of the data and the research questions, the project will primarily use unsupervised learning techniques such as clustering to group similar patients and descriptive statistics to summarize and explore the data. Additionally, exploratory data analysis (EDA) will be conducted to visualize the distributions and relationships between variables. Classification models may be considered later to predict diagnosis groups based on the available features



### Research Question:
The primary research question for this project is: *What are the key factors associated with different diagnosis groups in Alzheimer's disease, and how do these factors interrelate?*

### Relevant Domain Information :
1. *Alzheimer's Disease Overview*: An article providing a comprehensive overview of Alzheimer's disease, including its symptoms, risk factors, and current research trends. [Alzheimer's Association](https://www.alz.org/alzheimers-dementia/what-is-alzheimers)

2. *MMSE and Its Use in Alzheimer's Diagnosis*: An article detailing the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and its relevance in diagnosing cognitive impairments, particularly Alzheimer's disease. [Journal of Alzheimer's Disease](https://www.j-alz.com/content/mini-mental-state-examination-mmse)

### Data Source and Description:  
Kaggle - Alzheimer's Disease Dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rabieelkharoua/alzheimers-disease-dataset

This dataset includes various attributes related to patients with Alzheimer's disease:

- *Age*: Age of the patient.
- *Gender*: Gender of the patient.
- *BMI*: Body Mass Index.
- *SystolicBP*: Systolic Blood Pressure.
- *DiastolicBP*: Diastolic Blood Pressure.
- *CholesterolTotal*: Total Cholesterol levels.
- *MMSE*: Mini-Mental State Examination score.
- *Diagnosis*: Diagnosis group (e.g., healthy, mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease).

### Data Understanding and EDA:
Here are the interpretations for the visualizations:
### 1. Age Distribution
**Interpretation:**
The age distribution histogram shows how the ages of patients are distributed within the dataset. The `kde` (kernel density estimate) line provides a smoothed version of the histogram. Peaks in the histogram and KDE indicate the most common age ranges. If the distribution is skewed, it may suggest a bias towards a particular age group within the dataset.

### 2. Gender Distribution
**Interpretation:**
The gender distribution count plot displays the number of patients of each gender. This helps to understand the gender balance in the dataset. A significant imbalance might suggest that the dataset is not fully representative of the general population.

### 3. MMSE Score Distribution
**Interpretation:**
The MMSE (Mini-Mental State Examination) score distribution shows the frequency of various MMSE scores in the dataset. The KDE line provides a smoothed estimate of the distribution. This visualization helps to identify the common range of cognitive scores among patients, which can be useful for understanding the severity distribution of cognitive impairment.

### 4. Pairplot for Numeric Features
**Interpretation:**
The pairplot shows pairwise relationships between selected numeric features (Age, BMI, Systolic Blood Pressure, Diastolic Blood Pressure, Total Cholesterol, and MMSE). The diagonal plots show the KDE of each individual feature, while the off-diagonal plots show scatter plots of feature pairs, providing insight into potential correlations or patterns between features.

### 5. Correlation Matrix
**Interpretation:**
The correlation matrix heatmap visualizes the Pearson correlation coefficients between numeric features. Values close to 1 or -1 indicate strong positive or negative correlations, respectively. This helps to identify which features are related to each other, providing insights into potential multicollinearity or redundant features.

### 6. MMSE Scores by Diagnosis Group
**Interpretation:**
The boxplot shows the distribution of MMSE scores across different diagnosis groups. The boxes represent the interquartile range (IQR), with the line inside the box indicating the median. Whiskers show the range, and any outliers are displayed as individual points. This visualization helps to compare cognitive function (as measured by MMSE) across different diagnostic categories.

### 7. Scatter Plot for SystolicBP vs. DiastolicBP
**Interpretation:**
The scatter plot visualizes the relationship between systolic and diastolic blood pressure, with points colored by diagnosis group. This helps to identify any patterns or differences in blood pressure readings across different diagnosis categories. Clusters or trends can indicate how blood pressure varies with different health conditions.

### Data Preparation:
To prepare the Alzheimer’s disease dataset for analysis and modeling, the following steps were taken:

1.Loading the Dataset:The dataset was loaded from a CSV file.            
 
2.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

•Displayed the first few rows, basic information, and basic statistics.

•Checked for missing values and examined the distribution of key features like Age, Gender, and MMSE scores.
 
3.Handling Missing Values:

•If any missing values were found, strategies such as imputation or removal were employed based on the context.
	
4.Data Cleaning:

•Ensured that the data types of columns were appropriate.

•Converted categorical variables to numeric codes if necessary using pd.get_dummies() or LabelEncoder.
 
5.Feature Selection:

•Selected relevant numeric features for pairplot analysis to reduce computational load.

•Used data.select_dtypes(include=['float64', 'int64']) to filter numeric columns for the correlation matrix.
 
6.Sampling:

•For the pairplot, sampled 10% of the data to make the computation more manageable.
 
Further steps in data preparation and modeling will be detailed in Deliverable 2.
