### Project Introduction:
For our project, we've selected the Alzheimer's Disease dataset from Kaggle, created by Rabie El Kharoua. This dataset comprises various features pertinent to Alzheimer's disease diagnosis, including demographic, clinical, and neuroimaging data. Our primary objective is to develop a predictive model to assist in diagnosing Alzheimer's disease. We will utilize supervised learning techniques, specifically focusing on classification to differentiate between the various stages of Alzheimer's disease. 

The project will encompass both descriptive and predictive elements. We will begin with exploratory data analysis (EDA) to describe the data and uncover underlying patterns and relationships. This will involve visualizing the distributions of key variables, identifying potential correlations, and assessing data quality through missing value analysis and outlier detection. 

Subsequently, we will construct predictive models to classify the stages of Alzheimer's disease based on the provided features. We will evaluate multiple machine learning algorithms, such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines, to determine the most effective approach. Model performance will be assessed using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. 

Additionally, we will explore feature selection techniques to identify the most informative predictors and employ cross-validation to ensure the robustness of our models. The final model will aim to provide accurate and reliable stage classification, contributing valuable insights to the early diagnosis and treatment planning of Alzheimer's disease.

### Research Question:
Can we accurately predict the stage of Alzheimer's disease using demographic, clinical, and neuroimaging data?
